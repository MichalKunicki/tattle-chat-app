## Description
Showcase of a stream-chat-react engine and a basic ExpressJS backend set-up built on top of React. This project is a study on general application features like handling the state during the sign-up and log-in process, setting up the backend with Heroku, managing app content depending on the user, retrieving user data from cookies and using Axios API calls to communicate with the chat engine. The app supports functionalities like channel creation, direct messages, thread replies, emojis, GIFs, image sharing etc. It can be used as a private chatting tool for anyone who values privacy and doesn't want to use mainstream brands like Discord or Telegram.
